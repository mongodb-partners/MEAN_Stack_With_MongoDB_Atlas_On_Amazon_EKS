# Simplifying Application Modernization with Amazon EKS & MongoDB Atlas for developers
Deploy a MEAN Stack application with MongoDB Atlas as the backend on the Amazon EKS cluster

## Introduction
This is a technical repo to demonstrate the application deployment using MongoDB Atlas and AWS EKS. This tutorial is intended for those who want to

1. Serverless Application Deployment for Production Environment
2. Production deployment to auto-scale, HA, and Security
3. Agile development of application modernization
4. Deployment of containerized application in AWS
5. Want to try out the AWS EKS and MongoDB Atlas

## MongoDB Atlas
MongoDB Atlas is an all-purpose database having features like Document Model, Geo-spatial, Time-series, hybrid deployment, and multi-cloud services. It evolved as a "Developer Data Platform", intended to reduce the developer's workload on development and management of the database environment. It also provides a free tier to test out the application/database features.

## Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS)
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service to run Kubernetes in the AWS cloud and on-premises data centers. In the cloud, Amazon EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes responsible for scheduling containers, managing application availability, storing cluster data, and other key tasks. With Amazon EKS, you can take advantage of all the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS infrastructure, as well as integrations with AWS networking and security services. In this lab, you'll learn how to deploy a sample dockerized MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack application on a scalable and secure AWS infrastructure using Amazon EKS.
